    <p>
      I come from a background in restaurant management ranging from running
      QSRs myself, training and developing management teams, and up to
      overseeing up to just over 30 stores. This is where I first cut my teeth
      with programming, as overseeing so many restaurants and trying to give
      detailed feedback on numbers is very time-consuming.

      I taught myself just enough Visual Basic in Excel to create a macro that
      could analyze any number of spreadsheets and compile a summary of a
      store's performance. Armed with that, I was able to discuss issues with my
      managers and help them lower their operation costs. Using this tool, I was
      able to drop food cost at some of my problem stores by over 4% (~$50k/yr)!
      I learned then programming can be a fun, challenging, and effective way to
      tackle problems.
